# Business-Intelligence-Big-Data
Assignment for the course [Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst/content/business-intelligence-and-big-data-analytics) in the 4th year winter semester: 

Use SQL Server (database and analysis services) or MySQL + Pentaho:
1.  A large data set will be found, which will will be cleaned and inserted into a data warehouse. Then a data cube and various metrics should be created. [40%]
2.  A visualization tool (Tableau or Power BI) will be used to create various instances of data visualization. [20%]
3.  The warehouse data will be used for some mining operations, such as categorization, correlation rules, clustering, etc. Use trading system methods and models or an open-source tool. Implement at least two models. [40%]

The analysis concerns the Los Angeles crimes from 2010-19. In detail:
* [LA CRIME ANALYSIS.pdf](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data/blob/main/LA%20CRIME%20ANALYSIS.pdf) is the whole detailed analysis written in greek

* [DATA_MINING - CLUSTERING.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data/blob/main/DATA_MINING%20-%20CLUSTERING.ipynb) describes three different clustering analyses. 
* [RANDOM_TREES.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data/blob/main/RANDOM_TREES.ipynb) is the analysis of training decision trees and its extensions in order to predict the crime type of unique incidents by using the rest information.

# LA CRIME ANALYSIS
Assignment for the course [Business Intelligence and Big Data Analytics](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/dmst/content/business-intelligence-and-big-data-analytics) in the 4th year winter semester: 

Use SQL Server (database and analysis services) or MySQL + Pentaho:
1.  A large data set will be found, which will will be cleaned and inserted into a data warehouse. Then a data cube and various metrics should be created. [40%]
2.  A visualization tool (Tableau or Power BI) will be used to create various instances of data visualization. [20%]
3.  The warehouse data will be used for some mining operations, such as categorization, correlation rules, clustering, etc. Use trading system methods and models or an open-source tool. Implement at least two models. [40%]

The analysis concerns the Los Angeles crimes from 2010-19. All the information about the dataset can be found [here](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z). In detail:
* [LA CRIMES PRESENTATION.pdf](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data-Assignment/blob/main/LA%20CRIMES%20PRESENTATION.pdf) is the presentation of the analysis, application and conclusions. Quick way to examine the analysis. 
* [Clearing data.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data-Assignment/blob/main/Clearing%20data.ipynb) is the notebook file executing the ETL process (mostly extract and cleaning data).
* [Data Visualizations.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data-Assignment/blob/main/Data%20Visualizations.ipynb) are some examples of complex visualisations of the crime data by using of python. 
* [Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data-Assignment/blob/main/Clustering.ipynb) describes three different clustering analyses, visualizations about them and the conclusions. 
* [Machine Learning.ipynb](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data-Assignment/blob/main/Machine%20Learning.ipynb) is the analysis of training decision trees and their extensions in order to predict the crime type of unique incidents by using the rest information. 
* [LA Crimes Book Greek.pdf](https://github.com/stef4k/Business-Intelligence-Big-Data-Assignment/blob/main/LA%20Crimes%20Book%20Greek.pdf) is the whole book of the detailed analysis written in the greek language.
